# Policy Risk Predictor
A stacked ensemble model that combines Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost using Logistic Regression as a meta-learner to predict auto policy risk likelihood.

## Abstract
The insurance industry faces persistent challenges in accurately predicting claims and providing interpretable explanations for these predictions. This study proposes an AI framework that integrates classical machine learning (ML) techniques with large language models (LLMs) to predict insurance claims and generate human-readable explanations. Using the Kaggle Car Insurance Claims dataset, we address key challenges, including class imbalance and high-cardinality features. LLMs are employed to transform unstructured claim descriptions into structured representations and to provide natural language explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of combining LLMs and classical ML models in enhancing predictive performance and explainability, offering a robust and interpretable solution for decision-making in insurance.
